## The trust boundary

Guardrails exist at **two levels**, and only one of them is the security
boundary:

- **Prompt level (guidance).** The agent is told *exactly* which tools it has for
  its role, so it knows what it can and can't do and answers gracefully when asked
  for something out of scope. This is for *quality* — it is **not** a security
  control. The model can be wrong, hallucinate ids, or be steered by a
  prompt-injection hidden in a handbook chunk.
- **Code level (the boundary).** The server is what actually enforces access:
  `buildHrTools` only injects the tools a role may use, `can()` re-checks before
  every run, and the role-scoped `lib/hr` layer scopes every read. You could
  delete every prompt guideline and no role could reach data it shouldn't.

The two are kept in sync by construction: the prompt's capability list and the
injected toolset are both derived from the same `TOOL_CATALOGUE`, so they can
never disagree.

A consequence worth stating plainly: **a correctly-configured role never hits a
"permission denied".** Out-of-scope tools aren't offered, so they can't be called;
where a parameter would only ever be out of scope for a role it's dropped from
that role's tool schema entirely (so the query can't even be expressed — see
`getPayslip`); and the few residual refusals return `{ refused, message }` that
the agent relays in prose while the UI renders **nothing**. No card, no error
note — the agent simply works with the authorized data.

## The two kinds of identifier

| Kind | Question it answers | Where it must come from | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | "Who is acting?" | The session, via the closed-over `caller` — **never a tool argument** | If the model could pass `employeeId`, it could act as anyone. So "self" tools (`getLeaveBalance`, self-`getPayslip`, `requestTimeOff`) take **no** id. |
| **Selection** | "Which record?" | A tool argument is fine — but it **must be authorized server-side** against the caller's scope | Selecting another person's payslip or a leave request legitimately needs an id; the server re-checks the id is reachable for this caller. |

`caller` is built once in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` from the Auth.js session
(`{ role, employeeId, name }`) and captured by `buildHrTools(caller)`. A tool
closure cannot see anything the session didn't put there.

## The invariants

1. **Identity from the session, never from the model.** Tools read
   `caller.employeeId`; they do not accept it as input. (`route.ts`, `tools.ts`)

2. **One RBAC matrix gates everything.** `lib/rbac.ts` (`ROLE_PERMISSIONS` +
   `can()`) is the only source of "who may do what" — it gates the UI/sidebar,
   the dashboard pages, and the AI tools alike.

3. **Tools are advertised per role — irrelevant tools are never injected.**
   `buildHrTools(caller)` returns only the tools whose gating permission the role
   holds, driven by `TOOL_CATALOGUE`. The model never sees an out-of-scope tool,
   so it can't call, attempt, or be tricked into one. This is the primary
   guardrail; the per-tool checks below are defense in depth.

4. **One role-scoped data layer.** All *reads* go through `lib/hr.ts`, used by
   both the dashboard pages and the tools, so the chatbot can never return more
   than the UI would for that role. `directoryWhere(caller)` is the single
   "who can this caller see" predicate, shared by `getDirectory` and `getPayslip`.

5. **Every model-supplied id is authorized server-side.** A `requestId` or target
   `employeeId` from the model is validated against the caller's scope before any
   data is returned:
   - `getPayslip` resolves the target with one query that ANDs the id with
     `directoryWhere(caller)` — a guessed/out-of-scope id resolves to nothing.
   - `approveLeave` re-checks `req.employee.managerId === caller.employeeId`
     (unless the caller is company-wide HR) — a manager can't approve a
     non-report's request even though they hold `leave:approve`.
   Both are locked by tests in `tests/tools.integration.test.ts`.

6. **Fail closed, and invisibly.** There is no free-form / SQL / fetch tool to
   escalate through. A correctly-configured role never hits a denial (invariant
   #3); the residual target-scoped refusals return `{ refused, message }` — the
   model reads it and works with the authorized data, and the UI renders nothing.
   Never a throw, never a card or error note, no data touched. (Operational
   problems — bad dates, handbook down — still return `{ error }`, which the UI
   *does* show, since those are worth surfacing.)
   There is no "alert" side channel — refusing *is* the alert.

## Checklist — adding a new AI tool

When you add a tool, verify each line:

- [ ] **Add a `TOOL_CATALOGUE` row** with the permission that gates advertising it.
      That alone makes it appear only for roles that hold the permission — the
      prompt's capability list and the injected toolset both update automatically.
- [ ] **Identity is not an input.** If the tool acts on "the current user", read
      `caller.employeeId`; do not add an `employeeId` parameter for self-actions.
- [ ] **Re-check the permission before running** (defense in depth): wrap with
      `withPermission(caller, perm, …)`, or for per-target logic (self-vs-any)
      check `can()` inline *before* any query.
- [ ] **Reads go through `lib/hr.ts`.** Don't query `prisma` directly for reads in
      the tool; add or reuse a role-scoped helper so the UI and the tool share one
      scoping implementation. (Writes may live in the tool, but still re-check the
      target — see `approveLeave`.)
- [ ] **Any id argument is authorized against the caller's scope** before
      returning data — never trust that the model "got it from a prior tool".
      Resolve it through `directoryWhere(caller)` or an equivalent scoped query.
- [ ] **Scope refusals return `{ refused, message }`** (not `{ error }`, not a
      throw, not `{ denied: true }`) — the agent relays it and the UI shows
      nothing. Better still: if a parameter is only ever out of scope for the
      role, drop it from that role's schema so the query can't be expressed.
- [ ] **Add tests** for per-role exposure (the tool is/ isn't offered) and, if it
      takes an id, the out-of-scope-id path.

## What is intentionally *not* here

- **Opaque id handles / capability tokens.** A mature multi-tenant system might
  hand the model short session-scoped handles instead of raw cuids, to prevent id
  enumeration and to hide internal ids. We don't, because invariant #4 already
  makes a guessed id useless (it resolves to nothing), and the indirection layer
  would add machinery without closing a real hole in a starter. If this graduates
  to production with untrusted tenants, that's the first upgrade to make — it
  slots in at the tool boundary and the `lib/hr` resolution step.
- **Audit logging / real alerting.** Refusals are silent today. If added, the
  single choke point is `withPermission` (and the inline checks in `getPayslip` /
  `approveLeave`) — every refusal already passes through there.
