// Hybrid retrieval over the knowledge base: semantic search (pgvector cosine on
// the halfvec(384) column, HNSW index) + lexical search (Postgres full-text over
// the generated `contentTsv`, GIN index), fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The
// vector half catches paraphrase/synonyms; the lexical half catches exact terms
// (acronyms, names, IDs) embeddings miss. RRF fuses by RANK, so the two scores
// (cosine vs ts_rank) need no normalization.
//
// Authorization is enforced here in the query, not the prompt: only chunks of
// PUBLISHED documents whose visibility tier the caller may read are returned — the
// same "a tool can't see more than the UI" invariant as lib/hr.ts. Drafts and
// archived docs have no chunks (see lib/kb/ingest.ts); the status filter is
// belt-and-suspenders for any stale row.
